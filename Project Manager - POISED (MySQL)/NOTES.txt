Hi there
Please note that the updates do occur, to check it, please read the data again ( option 1 ) to see the changes
When creating the database please note I changed the datatype value of FINALISED to int(1)
I added my SQL statement to create the project table but I used the terminal to create the rest,sorry for the inconvience
The data added to the project table does not have a project that is overdue, to test this function please change the date in the update or finalise section
